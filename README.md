**Red-Black Tree Implementation using Python and Tkinter Visualization**

---

## Description
This repository contains an implementation of a Red-Black Tree data structure in Python. Red-Black Trees are a type of self-balancing binary search tree that maintains balance through specific rules on node placement and color assignments. The implementation is designed to support insertion, deletion, searching for keys or values, and tree visualization using Tkinter.

---

## Usage

### Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (for tree visualization)

### Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/red-black-tree.git
```

### Implementation
1. Import the RedBlackTree class in your Python file:
    ```python
    from red_black_tree import RedBlackTree
    ```
2. Initialize a Red-Black Tree:
    ```python
    red_black_tree = RedBlackTree()
    ```

3. Perform tree operations like insertion, deletion, searching, and more:
    ```python
    # Example usage
    red_black_tree.put(10, "A")  # Insert a key-value pair
    red_black_tree.delete(8)    # Delete a key
    red_black_tree.get(5)       # Retrieve the value associated with a key
    ```

4. Visualize the tree (for smaller trees):
    ```python
    red_black_tree.display_tree()
    ```

## Methods

The Red-Black Tree implementation includes various methods for tree manipulation, traversal, and analysis, such as:
- `put(key, value)`: Insert a key-value pair into the tree
- `delete(key)`: Remove a key-value pair from the tree
- `get(key)`: Retrieve the value associated with a given key
- `contains_key(key)`: Check if a key is present in the tree
- `contains_value(value)`: Check if a value is present in the tree
- `size()`: Return the number of key-value pairs in the tree
- `display_tree()`: Visualize the tree structure using Tkinter

Refer to the code for a comprehensive list of available methods and their descriptions.

## Visualization
The implementation provides a method, `display_tree()`, for visualizing the structure of the Red-Black Tree using Tkinter. This visualization tool allows for better understanding and examination of smaller trees.

Please note that the visualization might not be suitable for large trees due to layout constraints.
